# Senior-Research-SQLIA
This is my senior research about comparing the different detection and prevention methods for SQLIA.
SQL Injection Attacks are a threat to databases around the world. While they have been a simple attack to prevent methods should be tested to make sure that a company is not using a inerior method.

To test these methods they will be tested on:
    Detection and prevention time.
    Accuracy of SQLIs detected and prevented.
    False positve rate.
